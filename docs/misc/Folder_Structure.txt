I want to redefine the folder structure as follows:

+---Auto_Generate
|   +---Output
|	|   +---TCD
|   +---Reqifz_Files
|   +---Sample
|	|   +---TCD
|   +---Src

Reqifz_Files - Folder, where all the REQIFZ files are stored. New REQIFZ files will be added here.
Output\TCD - Folder where the generated TCD files are stored
Sample\TCD - Same TCD files are stored
Src - Python scripts are stored here

Always remember this folder structure for future activities, untill this is changed.
