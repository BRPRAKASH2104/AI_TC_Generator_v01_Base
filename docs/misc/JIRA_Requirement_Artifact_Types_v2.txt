1. System Requirements

These represent the core functional logic of the system. Each requirement describes what the system should do, including:
	•	Expected input conditions
	•	Desired output behavior

System requirements may be expressed in various formats to enhance clarity:
	•	Textual descriptions
	•	Flow diagrams
	•	State diagrams
	•	Images or illustrations
	•	Structured tables

✅ Use Case: These form the basis for test case generation and traceability.

⸻

2. System Interface

This artifact defines the interfaces referenced in the system requirements. It includes:
	•	Input and output definitions
	•	Local variables
	•	HMI (Human-Machine Interface) components

✅ Use Case: Essential for understanding how different components interact and for identifying testable elements in the system.

⸻

3. Design Information

This consists of architectural diagrams and technical references that support system understanding. It typically includes:
	•	Block diagrams
	•	Signal flows
	•	Input/output mappings
	•	State transitions

✅ Use Case: Helps in visualizing system design and supporting detailed test design.

⸻

4. Application Parameters

These are specific parameters considered during test case development. They may include:
	•	Input and output parameters
	•	Configurable settings
	•	Local variables

✅ Use Case: Used to derive test data variations and boundary value conditions.

⸻

5. Informational References

This section contains supporting material that aids in requirement interpretation. It may include:
	•	Flowcharts
	•	Supporting block diagrams
	•	Any critical background details

✅ Use Case: Provides additional context when decoding complex system logic.

⸻

6. Heading (Contextual Summary)

A brief summary placed at the beginning of each requirement to provide context. It helps stakeholders quickly understand:
	•	The focus of the requirement
	•	Its relevance or criticality
	•	Role in the broader system

✅ Use Case: Used by test authors and reviewers to grasp requirement intent at a glance.

✅ Final Notes
Each artifact plays a unique role in understanding and developing test cases for validating system behavior.
